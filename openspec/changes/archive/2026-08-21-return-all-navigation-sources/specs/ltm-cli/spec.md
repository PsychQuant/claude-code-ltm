## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: ltm query prints pointered hits in human and JSON forms

`ltm query <text>` SHALL print up to k (default 20) hits. Human-readable output SHALL show rank, project, timestamp, snippet, and the pointer. With `--json`, output SHALL be a JSON array whose objects each carry `project`, `sessionId`, `uuid`, `timestamp`, `snippet`, `score`, and `band`; when a reordering strategy is active each object SHALL additionally carry the seam's displacement and reason fields; when event recording produced a presentation identifier for that hit, the object SHALL additionally carry a `presentation` field containing that identifier.

Both forms SHALL surface the hit's full source set, as defined by the `corpus-indexing` capability's "Chunk granularity is one conversation turn with full pointer metadata" Requirement and required on every result by the `retrieval` capability. This capability specifies only the two output shapes:

- **Human-readable**: when the hit has exactly one holding source, the pointer line SHALL be unchanged from its single-source form. When the hit has more than one, the line SHALL name every holding session identifier, using a plural label so that a turn existing in several files is visible without counting.
- **`--json`**: every object SHALL carry a `sessions` array of the holding session identifiers, with at least one element. This field SHALL be present unconditionally, including for single-source hits — unlike `displacement` and `presentation`, which are absent when the query has no such concept, every hit always has at least one source.

#### Scenario: JSON output is machine-complete

- **WHEN** `ltm query "fixture phrase" --json` returns 3 hits
- **THEN** the output parses as a JSON array of 3 objects and every object contains non-empty `project`, `sessionId`, `uuid`, `timestamp` fields plus `snippet`, `score`, `band`

#### Scenario: JSON output exposes the presentation identifier when events were recorded

- **WHEN** `ltm query "fixture phrase" --json --record` returns hits and successfully writes events
- **THEN** every object in the output array carries a `presentation` field, and running the same query without `--record` produces objects with no `presentation` field

#### Scenario: JSON carries the sessions array for both single-source and multi-source hits

- **GIVEN** a corpus where one turn is held by two session files and another turn is held by exactly one
- **WHEN** `ltm query --json` retrieves both
- **THEN** the multi-source hit's `sessions` array has two elements and the single-source hit's has one, and both hits' `sessionId` values appear in their own `sessions` array

#### Scenario: Human-readable output names every source only when there is more than one

- **GIVEN** the same corpus as the preceding scenario
- **WHEN** `ltm query` prints both hits in human-readable form
- **THEN** the single-source hit's pointer line is unchanged from its single-source form, and the multi-source hit's pointer line names both session identifiers under a plural label
